-- ******************* Sales by Day of the Week ******************************
-- Problem Statement
-- Retrieve a report that displays the total sales for each day of the week from the provided sales data table. 
-- The report should present the results in a format that clearly indicates the sales amount for each day of the week. 
-- The table contains records of transactions, including:

-- 1.the transaction ID
-- 2.the date of the purchase
-- 3.and the amount of the purchase

-- To solve this problem, we need to group the sales data by the day of the week, calculate the total sales amount for each day, 
-- and present the results in a clear and organized format. This report will help in analyzing the sales patterns and identifying which 
-- days of the week have higher sales volumes. The final output should show the sales amount for each day of the week.
CREATE DATABASE SALESDATA;

USE SALESDATA;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS SalesData;

CREATE TABLE SalesData (
    TransactionID INT,
    PurchaseDate DATE,
    Amount DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

INSERT INTO SalesData (TransactionID, PurchaseDate, Amount) VALUES
    (1, '2023-08-14', 50.00),
    (2, '2023-08-15', 75.00),
    (3, '2023-08-15', 60.00),
    (4, '2023-08-16', 45.00),
    (5, '2023-08-16', 55.00),
    (6, '2023-08-17', 90.00),
    (7, '2023-08-17', 70.00),
    (8, '2023-08-17', 120.00),
    (9, '2023-08-18', 65.00),
    (10, '2023-08-18', 85.00);
    
   -- Now hereâ€™s how to create a report of the sales by day of the week using SQL: 
    SELECT 
          DAYNAME(PurchaseDate) AS DayOfWeek,
          SUM(Amount) AS TotalSales
	FROM 
         SalesData
	GROUP BY DAYOFWEEK(PurchaseDate),DAYNAME(PurchaseDate)
    ORDER BY DAYOFWEEK(PurchaseDate);
/*    
# DayOfWeek	TotalSales
Monday	      50.00
Tuesday	      135.00
Wednesday	  100.00
Thursday	  280.00
Friday	      150.00

*/
    
-- Our query retrieves the day name and calculates the total sales amount for each day of the week from the SalesData table.
--  It does this by first using the DAYNAME() function to extract the day name from the PurchaseDate column and then 
-- applying the SUM() function to calculate the total sales amount.
-- The results are grouped based on both the numerical day of the week and the day name,
--  ensuring accurate grouping across different weeks. The query orders the results by the numerical day of the week. 
-- It allows the output to display the total sales for each day of the week, even if certain days have zero sales recorded in the data.
